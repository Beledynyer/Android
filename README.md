This was my Third year group project "The Agora" 

1	SYSTEM OVERVIEW
1.1	Problem Description 
The current system of disseminating information through university memos and portals has proven to be ineffective and inefficient for students and staff. Weekly memos posted on the student portals and sent via email are often cumbersome to sift through, making it difficult for individuals to find events such as seminars, concerts, or workshops that they would be interested in attending. Even after finding an event, students and staff members must set their own reminders, adding to the complexity of managing their schedules.
Additionally, while the student portal contains a section where students can post and view adverts, this feature is not widely known among the student community. As a result, students often resort to posting physical posters on campus to promote their events or services, further cluttering the campus environment.
The Agora seeks to address these challenges by offering a comprehensive platform that enables users to access university news, stay updated on upcoming events, and interact with fellow students and staff. Users can also set reminders for events they wish to attend. This platform will serve as a centralized hub for all university-related information, simplifying the process of finding relevant announcements and events for students and staff. Additionally, The Agora will provide a space for students to advertise items or services they wish to sell and seek advice from their peers, fostering a more connected and informed university community.
The Agora seeks to enhance university connectivity and information-sharing.
1.2	Project Assumptions  & Constraints
The system will only be accessible to Nelson Mandela University Students and staff members. It is assumed users are familiar with technology and will be connected to the internet while using the System.

Users will register and log in with their university details. Staff members and students will have a similar view on the web-based platform, with the only difference being:
•	 Only students can post on the market listings (the “My Listings” tab will be accessible to students only) 
•	Only staff members can post announcements.

On the Android-based system, staff members only view posts pending approval and staff members cannot post anything on the forum.

The system automatically identifies whether a user is a student, or staff member based on the details provided when registering. Students can only delete the posts they have made under an announcement or forum post.

Staff members in the announcement's sections will not post any misleading information and will not be moderated. 
Students & Staff members in the comment section of announcements will adhere to the rules of orderly conduct, hence no moderating will be required as well. Student’s comments under Forum posts will be moderated using a profanity filter API.

The Forum platform will be implemented on android and Announcements and Market Listing on web.
To sign out of the system, users can simply click on their profile or tap it if using an Android device, to access the logout page and proceed with logging out.

I handled the Forum Post part on Android.
